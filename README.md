### Problem Statement:



.
### Half Adder:
Half Adder has two inputs, and it has two outputs which are the sum and carry. For example, if both inputs are 1 the output in sum will be 0 and the carry will be 1.


.
### Full Adder using combined Half-Adder:



.
### 8-bit parallel binary Adder:



.
### 8-bit parallel binary Subtractor:

Subtraction can be represented as adding a positive number to a negative number, for example: 4–2 = 4 + (-2) 
the real question is, how do we represent a negative number in binary?
One of the most efficient ways is to use 2’s complement which basically is to invert the added value and add 1 to the total.  
The way we will represent that in the Subtraction component we re-used the 8-bit adder the only difference is that the circuit inverts the B inputs and sets the carry input to 1.
As you can see, we added an enable button to control the circuit and to add 1 to the carry.
